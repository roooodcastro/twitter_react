# Twitter React

This is a toy app that I'll use as a playground for learning React.
It's obviously going to be a Twitter clone.

It uses:

* Ruby 2.4.1
* Rails 5.1
* Mysql 5.6
* The new Webpacker gem with Yarn
* React 15.5

Dependencies:

* Ruby 2.3 or higher
* Rails 5.1 or higher
* Node
* Yarn
* Mysql (I'm using 5.6)
